**My Individual Contribution — Milestone 1 **

**In Milestone 1, I completed the full Data Collection & Preprocessing pipeline:**

-Set up Kaggle API and configured kaggle.json for secure dataset downloads.

-Created the complete project folder structure for raw and processed data.

-Downloaded two major datasets:

-COVID-19 Radiography (X-ray images)

-Medical Transcriptions (EHR notes)

-Built the image preprocessing pipeline:

-Handled PNG/JPG/JPEG/DICOM images

-Converted to grayscale, normalized, resized to 256×256

-Saved all outputs in a unified processed dataset

-Verified dataset integrity and ensured all processed files were correctly stored for team use.

✔ Total images processed: 21,165
✔ Provided clean, standardized data for the next milestones.
